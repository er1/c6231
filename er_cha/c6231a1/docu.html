<p>In this project we were asked to produce a distributed police information system. </p>
<p>There are a minimum two running processes with several threads.</p>
<p>One process for the RMI servers each with a thread for each station.
Each station forks an additional thread for its UDP server for inter-
station requests.</p>
<p>The <code>StationServer</code> class is instantiated for each server, this class
then creates a thread to listen to UDP requests.</p>
<p>UDP requests are serialized Maps and the serialization and parsing is
taken care of in static methods of the <code>MapSerializer</code> class.</p>
<p>Records are stored as <code>Record</code> objects which is extended into
<code>CriminalRecord</code> objects for criminal records and <code>MissingRecord</code>
objects for missing person records.</p>
<p><code>RecordContainer</code> contains all <code>Records</code> in a protected field called
<code>records</code>. <code>records</code> is an array containin 26 <code>HashMap</code>s of <code>Record</code>s
keyed on <code>String</code>s which are the IDs of the records.</p>
<p>When records are added (or potentially removed) the corresponding map
for that record is locked with Java's <code>synchronized</code> mechanism.
	Similarly, this is used to lock the whole <code>records</code> array when making
	the count of records on a particular server.</p>
	<p>When we are reading or modifying records, we lock them on the specific
	<code>Record</code> with <code>synchronized</code> so it is in a consistent state.</p>
	<p><code>StationServer</code> implements the <code>StationInterface</code> for RMI.
	<code>StationInterface</code> extends Java's RMI <code>Remote</code> Interface so that it
	may be exported via RMI to officers or clients in <code>OfficerClient</code></p>
	<p>Another process for clients is made to decouple them from the server.
	The client processes may have as many officer connections as it needs.</p>
	<p>Officer connections are made through makeing an <code>OfficerClient</code>
	instance for each connection. This object takes care of creating the
	appropriate log as well as doing the RMI lookup and making the
	connection.</p>
	<p>Using this, two executable clients were written, <code>OfficerMenuClient</code>
	and <code>OfficerTestClient</code>. <code>OfficerMenuClient</code> allowed the user to pick
	a badgeID and use it to execute individual commands against the server
	in an interactive manner.</p>
